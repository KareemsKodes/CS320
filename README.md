How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
There are many things that can be done to ensure code is functional and secure. The first of these things is to make sure to use best coding practices and to plan your design ahead of time. This helps to alleviate issues that may come up due to forgotton requirements or errors. There are also various testing methods that can be implemented that can help to ensure that the code is functional and secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpretting user needs is a very important part of programming. Having a conversation, taking note of what is desired, and creating a framework for what needs to be done is the best outline I can think of for interpretting user needs into a program. You can use the framework you create to plan out the code.


How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software first by gathering the requirements. I then break down the requirements into an outline for my code. I chart out what methods will be neededs and how I might approach coding those methods. I then create the code based on the design, test, adjust as needed, and test some more.
